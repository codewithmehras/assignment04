void main(){

// if we use ++ operator it will increase the value by 1.
// it is will not increase in the same line because dart is not support the ++ operator in print statement directly.
// in next line 1 will bw added to a.
// for example:

int a = 5;
print(  a); // it will print 5
a++;
print(a); // it will print 6








}// Output://5
//6
