  print("Diferencw between List and Map in Dart:");
  //   1) A Map is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique and is used to access its corresponding value.
  //2)Maps are useful when you need to associate values with specific keys and retrieve them based on those keys.
  // 3)It uses curly braces {} to define a map and colons : to separate keys from values.
  // Example:

  
  Map<String, int> exampleMap = {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 3};

  print(exampleMap);

  //    1)A List is an ordered collection of items where each item can be accessed by its index. It is similar to an array in other programming languages.
  // 2)Lists are useful when you need to maintain a sequence of elements and access them by their position.
  // 3)It uses square brackets [] to define a list and commas , to separate items.
  // Example:

  print("Example of List:");

  List<String> exampleList = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

  print(exampleList);

    // summary:
    //   In summary, use a Map when you need to associate values with unique keys, and use a List when you need an ordered collection of items accessed by their index.
